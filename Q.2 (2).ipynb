    "\n",
    "Ans-The Four pillars of object-oriented programmings are\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation:\n",
    "    Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data(attributes)\n",
    "    and methods(functions) that operate on that data into a \n",
    "    single unit called a class. It helps in data hiding and\n",
    "    protecting the internal state of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Abstraction:\n",
    "    Abstraction refers to the process of simplifying complex \n",
    "    reality by modeling classes based on the essential \n",
    "    properties and behaviours an object should have. It hides\n",
    "    the complex implementation details and focuses on the \n",
    "    essential features.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Inheritance:\n",
    "    Inheritance is a mechanism in which a new class can inherit\n",
    "    properties and behaviours (attributes and methods) from an \n",
    "    existing class. It promotes code reusability and the \n",
    "    creation of hierarchies of classes.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Polymorphism:\n",
    "    Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be \n",
    "    treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables\n",
    "    flexibility and dynamic behaviour,where the same method\n",
    "    name can behave differently depending on the object that calls\n",
    "    it.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n"
